Mind Crypt
=========

[Click here to see the fully working demo of this app](http://thinktt.github.io/mindCrypt/)  

This is an adaptation of the infamous "Lady Esmerelda's Crystal Ball". I'm pretty sure the original was made by  [Andy Wolfe.](http://www.flashlightcreative.net/)

This app demonstrates using Bootstrap and jQuery together. It also features some fun HTML5 animation and is mobile reponsive.  

It is published under the MIT licence.
