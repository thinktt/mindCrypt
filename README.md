This is an adaptation of the infamous "Lady Esmerelda's Crystal Ball".

This app demonstrates using Bootstrap and jQuery together. It also features some fun HTML5 animation.  

Eventually it should be mobile responsive although right now it is not quite there yet. 

It is published under the MIT licence.
